# DevOps 30 Day Challenge

This repository is created to consolidate all of the projects for the 30 day challenge. The 30 day challenge can be found on LinkedIn.

There will be a directory for each day of the challenge. The following must be present in each directory:

Readme.md - file that contains instructions for implementing the individual project, reference to the architecture diagram, and to the video for the challenge.
Terraform template(s) - file(s) to deploy all required resources for the project.
Architecture Diagram - Visual representation of the implemented services/resources for the project.
The intent is to maintain a repository showcasing individual projects implemented in line with the challenge.
